      <h1>Legate My Car – Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Effective date: 8 November 2025</p>
      <p>
        Legate My Car (&ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;, or &ldquo;our&rdquo;)
        provides this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, disclose,
        and safeguard personal information within the Legate My Car mobile
        application (the &ldquo;App&rdquo;). By using the App, you agree to the
        terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue
        use of the App.

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

          <strong>Account and authentication data:</strong> When you sign in
          with Google, we receive your name, email address, and Google profile
          identifier.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lost car reports:</strong> Information you submit about a
          vehicle, including chassis number, plate number, car name/model,
          color, last known location, and contact phone number.

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Location data:</strong> The App does not request continuous

          assets, with prior notice and continued protection.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>

      <p>
        The App is not directed to children under 13 years of age, and we do not

        have collected personal data from a child under 13 (or under the minimum
        age in the relevant jurisdiction), we will promptly delete it. Parents
        or guardians who believe their child has provided information may
        contact us to request deletion.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8. Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement technical and organizational measures designed to protect
        personal information against unauthorized access, alteration,
        disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission or
        storage is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>9. International Transfers</h2>

        Your information may be processed and stored in countries other than
        your own. We ensure appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual
        clauses, are in place to protect your personal information when it is
        transferred internationally.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>10. Updates to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the
        revised policy on this page with a new effective date. If changes are
        significant, we may notify you through the App or other appropriate
        channels. Continued use of the App after changes become effective means
        you accept the updated policy.
